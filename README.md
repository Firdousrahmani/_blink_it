In today’s fast-paced retail landscape, making data-driven decisions isn’t just an advantage—it’s a necessity. I recently worked on building a Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, aiming to uncover valuable insights into sales performance, outlet efficiency, and product trends.

The goal was simple: to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights that can help optimize operations, enhance customer experience, and improve business strategy. Here’s what the numbers revealed.

**Key Insights:**

• Revenue at a Glance – Blinkit generated $1.2M in total sales, with an average order value of $141, highlighting strong consumer demand.

• Outlet Performance – Large outlets dominate, contributing 42% of total sales, whereas smaller outlets account for only 21%, raising questions about scalability and space utilization.

• Location Matters – Tier 3 locations are the top performers, generating $472.1K in sales, suggesting that demand in emerging markets is stronger than expected.

• What Sells the Most? – Fruits, snack foods, and household items lead in sales, reinforcing the importance of everyday essentials in quick commerce.

• Consumer Preferences – 65% of sales come from regular fat products, providing direction for stocking strategies and consumer health preferences.

**Why This Matters:**

> Identifying high-performing outlets helps in better resource allocation and expansion planning.

> Understanding regional sales variations ensures optimized inventory and logistics.

> Product demand insights enable smarter promotions and targeted marketing.
